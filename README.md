# AIS-Analyss

AIS Data: It is the information broadcasted by the vessel, including name, MMSI  code, IMO code, coordinates, vessel type, heading, width, length, and timestamp.
Data Period: 2020.04.01 - 2022.05.25
Data file: 7 days per file and 112 spreadsheets.
Data Quality:
1. Data source doesnâ€™t come from the Marine traffic.
2. Missing MMSI, IMO code or name.
3. Missing vessel type or other information.
4. Time interval is not fixed. 
5. Isolated points.
6. AIS signal is all over the world including landlocked countries or mountains.

Vessel Track: Build up the track by connecting data points with the MMSI code(or IMO code ) and sorting by the timestamp. Also filtering by the timestamp, if the time gap for two consecutive points is more than 4 hours, the tracking line would be split into two-part.
